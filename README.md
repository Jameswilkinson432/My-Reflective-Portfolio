## Week 2:
### What have I learnt this week?
This week I was introduced to the idea of many model thinking. This included a basic introduction to types of models as well as how models may be used in the real world.
### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
I now know a clearer definition of what models are and what they are not, as well as a basic understanding of some theorems surrounding models (Diversity prediction theorem, Condorcet Jury theorem).
### What insights have I gained?
I’ve gained insights into the wisdom hierarchy, and how many model thinking paired with the use of different and varying models can help us to understand situations and predict outcomes with greater accuracy.
### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
Strengths include understanding how a theorem works, however I would say i had difficulty when trying to come up with independent situations in which these theorems would work.
### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
Challenges I encountered were understanding the new concepts that were discussed. I think I handled them well by looking into them further until I gained a greater understanding of application.
### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
I definitely need to hone my ‘note taking’ skills so I can be more accurate and look back at past notes with ease.
What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
The Idea of the wisdom hierarchy I found extremely interesting and useful when it comes to predict outcomes and contextualise data. 
 
 
 
## Week 3:
### What have I learnt this week?
Week 3 focussed on the core set of models that are used when doing many model thinking. We also learnt the idea of modelling people to predict emergent behaviours of society in unforeseen situations.
### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
We were introduced to a lot of models that we had not looked at before, and thus I have learnt the basic understanding of how these models work and can be implemented in the real world.
### What insights have I gained?
I've gained insights into how to make better decisions through normative reasoning (making better decisions for myself), and Positive reasoning (predicting the behaviour of others and why they behave in a certain way).
### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
Similar to last week, I still have some weaknesses when it comes to completely understanding how a model may be used in real world situations, however I think i’m beginning to show more strength in this area and am gaining a better grasp on the ideas put forward to us.
### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
I felt challenged when trying to understand Shapley’s value, however after looking over the idea a few times and looking at some youtube videos to help explain uses etc. I feel like I have a much greater understanding.
### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
I got a bit distracted in the week 3 lecture and kept looking at my phone. I think this definitely contributed to my struggling to understand Shapley’s value and thus I intend to abstain from looking at my phone in future.
### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
The theories surrounding decision making proved to be extremely useful for everyday life when it came to making any decisions no matter how big or small. I have therefore learnt from this how to make better decisions for myself in future (I hope).
 
## Week 4
### What have I learnt this week?
Week 4 focussed on the representation of human centered complex systems. This included system dynamic models, the idea of networking as well as agent-based models. We discussed how each of these models worked and learnt the basic applications of these models. For example, System dynamic models are used in real world situations such as the correlation between predator/prey and the subsequent predicted populations of both animals. However, they can be used in many, many other situations relating to the economy, environmental relationships, or pretty much any relationship between two or more things if mapped properly. Furthermore Networking and agent based models were introduced which I learnt are similar yet have different uses. Networking can be used to display predicted spread of something, whether it be information or a virus, while agent based modeling is used more to predict how humans will react based on their own set of rules.
### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
I now know how Networking, Agent based models and System dynamic models can be used to plot outcomes when certain rules are applied to a situation or relationship between two variables. 
### What insights have I gained?
I have gained insight into the usefulness of System dynamic modelling specifically, with the example of deer population making it super easy for me to understand how they work and in what situations they may be used. Furthermore the idea of networking and the diagram shown there spoke to me, especially showing how the spread of a virus can be modelled through network modelling (meta).
### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
Strengths:
Understanding the basic principles of the models shown + real world implementations
Connecting what we learnt today to what we’ve learnt in the previous weeks.
Weaknesses:
When I don’t understand something off the bat I can focus too much on it, leading me to miss out on the following information explained and thus falling further behind.
When trying to understand something I sometimes lack confidence in what I’ve perceived to be correct.
 
### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
In future I would attempt to focus more when things are explained the first time, and if I do not understand them then I would leave that work for later in order to not fall behind and get lost in the rest of the workshop.
 
 
## Week 5
### What have I learnt this week?
This week's topic of aggregating decisions and behaviour focuses on collecting real world data to formulate real-world statistics through the probability distribution methods. I learnt how to formulate these distributions and for what types of data they can represent and be useful for.
### What insights have I gained?
I’ve gained insights into how probability distributions work, how they are calculated and how they may be used in conjunction with real world data to create usable statistics and predict future trends in these stats.
### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
Strengths:
Understanding the data and what it means
Weaknesses:
The actual formula took me a bit to get my head around
 
### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
The mathematical aspect of the formula was a challenge to understand, but i was able to overcome that with trial and error/ lots of practice.
## Week 6
### What have I learnt this week?
This week we learnt the ideas of random walks, broad, diffusion, and contagion, as well as markov models. I specifically found markov models interesting, which demonstrated the likelihood of a variable switching between states when given a stimuli. The example given was for students in a class switching between being bored or alert. I thought this could be used in many interesting ways to demonstrate and plot many many different scenarios in the real world.
### What insights have I gained?
I have gained further insight into how modelling can be used in the real world to plot many different scenarios and outcomes. Additionally, beginning to look into the assignment, I have gained insight into how some of these models may come in handy when plotting whatever real-world scenario we decide to choose.
### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
Being the first week of the assignment, my team had some difficulty settling on an issue. I think we all have different ideas of what could be good but with a little communication and further discussion about the topics we’re thinking about I believe that we’ll come to a successful conclusion.
 
 
## Week 7
### What have I learnt this week?
This week we began focussing on complexity and emergent behaviour of people. The discussion surrounding segregation and why people tend to live with and around people that are similar to them i found extremely interesting. Following on the “micro incentives does not equal macro outcomes” was cool, learning about how even though a small portion of a population followed a rule it still led to a much larger change.
### What insights have I gained?
This week I gained insights into how a population that follows sets of rules work in reality. Additionally, how i may plot and predict a population's response using the varying models displayed to us. The uses of these models are extremely important this week as my team are still thinking of an issue to discuss in our assignment, and therefore while discussing these models i’ve been thinking about the possible uses of these within our possible issues.
### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
Strengths:
Understanding of the blotto game and how it can apply to different scenarios
Weaknesses:
Communication within the group to settle on a final issue and begin working on the assignment properly.
Looked back on previous models and had forgotten majority of the in depth details of them -- planning to go over them all again briefly / focus on whatever we use for the assignment
 
 
## Week 8
### What have I learnt this week?
This week we learnt about blotto’s game and the prisoner's dilemma. I found this week especially interesting as these concepts are able to be transferred into a lot of real world scenarios to help with decision making. I thought the prisoner's dilemma was mildly confusing to begin with however with further explanation from Juan (<3) I was able to successfully grasp this concept. I also learnt about blotto’s game and how that can and has been used within the real world, such as in various wars as a strategy to succeed with fewer troops/resources.
### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
I know all about blotto’s and the prisoner's dilemma and how they work. This includes their real-world implementation and how they can be used by me to make better decisions in future.
### What insights have I gained?
Blotto’s game gained a lot of insight into how it can be used in real world situations to achieve a goal, even if not all the requirements are met. Specifically, this relates to our group assignment as we have chosen gender inequality. Blotto’s game can be translated into understanding many factors of gender inequality, such as job-gain for women, or why domestic abuse is rising due to COVID.
### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
Strengths:
Beginning to understand a clear outline of where our assignment is heading and how we are going to achieve a successful outcome.
Weaknesses:
No weaknesses really - think I’m going pretty strong this week.
 
 
## Week 9
### What have I learnt this week?
We did not have any workshop this week, and we are waiting for our assignment presubmission to be returned so I decided to look into successful ways that gender equality has been achieved (relating to our assignment). I found a really interesting chapter in the book ”Solved!” that discussed how Iceland is leading the world in gender equality and the steps it’s taken to achieve this. I’m making sure to keep this all in mind for when we have to plot our models for our assignments, as the steps Iceland has taken could prove extremely useful when trying to achieve a positive outcome in our own models.
### What insights have I gained?
I have gained a lot of insight into how gender inequality can be achieved and what steps can help to reach this goal. This will prove extremely useful when plotting our own solutions to gender inequality in our models.
### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
Strengths:
Working as a group to communicate what needs to get done by when 
Completing the work by a deadline to keep us all organised
 
 
Weaknesses
Github is hard to work with sometimes 
### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
In future I need to allow myself more time to research data and statistics surrounding the assignment in order to produce a more thorough report.
 
## Week 10
### What insights have I gained?
Due to extensive research surrounding gender equality, I have gained deeper insight into the extent of this issue and how it affects society. I now understand the underlying issues and problems and possible solutions to these problems for when we begin modelling.
### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
A big challenge that I faced this week was beginning to plot out system dynamic models that can be used for our assignment. I found some code that I could use along with some pre-created programs, but i'm going to need to understand a lot more in depth how these work and read into some tutorials or videos of how to properly build one in order to collect relevant and useful data that can help us in the assignment.
